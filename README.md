# Conference-page
Microverse HTML &amp; CSS capstone project: Conference page
In this project, i'm using Html, CSS & little bit of Javascript to build capstone project.
Project is based on an online website for a conference, but i created website for our team meeting after we finish Microverse.
As much as i can i followed the best practices that i already learned in the previous projects, like setting-up a code linter, using Github flow, making good commit messages and writing a good README.
Website consists of 3 pages - main page, about page and tickets page, Each of these pages has been designed to be responsive for all device sizes.
